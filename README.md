# EduFocal's Docker Configuration

Setup your development environment quickly using this stack.

First our setup script below and follow the prompt for your github username and password:
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EduFocal/misc/master/clonedocker.sh | bash
```

This will install all the containers and build them.

There is also an optional screen / vim workspace you can start using right away with:
```
make screen
```
